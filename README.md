## Building it
We use maven, node, and gulp to build the project. You need to install
maven on your computer. Maven handles downloading and installing node
and gulp for you. Maven installs node in the .eurekaclinical/dev
directory in your home directory. It installs the node modules that
are needed to build this project in the node_modules directory at the
root of this project.

To build the project, execute `mvn clean install` at the command
line. For simple file changes, not additions or deletions, you can
usually use `mvn install`. To create a zipfile suitable for
distribution, execute `mvn install -Pdist`.

## Performing system tests
To run the web client on your machine for testing purposes, do the
following:

1. Clone the [eurekaclinical-analytics-webapp](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/eurekaclinical-analytics-webapp)
project from GitHub, and execute `mvn clean install`
followed by `mvn process-resources cargo:run -Ptomcat` in the root directory of the
project on the command line to run the server-side Eureka! Clinical
Analytics code in embedded tomcat. The backend services must be
listening on port 8443, which is the default.
2. Back in the root directory of the web client project, execute
`mvn clean install -Pwebserver`. It will open the web client in your
default web browser at https://localhost:8000 in an embedded web
server. You can leave the backend Eureka! Clinical Analytics code running while you
repeatedly build and run the web client.

## Installation
Copy the contents of the `dist` directory into your web server's
content directory in the folder of your choice.

### Configuration
This web client is configured using a JSON file, `config.json`, that
should be in the same directory as the index.html file on your web
server. It supports specifying the following options:
* `casLoginUrl`: The URL for logging into your CAS server. The default
  value is `https://localhost:8000/cas-server/login`.
* `logoutUrl`: The URL that the web client will go to when the user
  clicks the `Logout` click in the upper right corner of the
  page. Before going to this URL, the web client will destroy the
  user's session. The default value is
  `https://localhost:8000/cas-server/logout`, which logs the user out
  of CAS.
* `eurekaWebappUrl`: The URL for eureka-webapp. The default value is
  `https://localhost:8000/eurekaclinical-analytics-webapp`.

Specify the options as properties of a single JSON object. See the
default `config.json` file in the root directory of this project for a
sample. The default file is copied into the `dist` directory during the
build process.

## Developer documentation
The build process creates an `ng-docs` directory in the root directory
of this project. Load the `index.html` file in this directory into
your web browser to view the developer documentation.
